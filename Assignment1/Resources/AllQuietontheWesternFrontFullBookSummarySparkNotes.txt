A group of new recruits comes to reinforce
the company, and Paul’s friend Kat produces a beef and bean stew
that impresses them. Kat says that if all the men in an army, including
the officers, were paid the same wage and given the same food, wars would
be over immediately. Kropp, another of Paul’s former classmates,
says that there should be no armies; he argues that a nation’s leaders
should instead fight out their disagreements with clubs. They discuss
the fact that petty, insignificant people become powerful and arrogant
during war, and Tjaden, a member of Paul’s company, announces that
the cruel Corporal Himmelstoss has come to fight at the front.
At night, the men go on a harrowing mission to lay barbed
wire at the front. Pounded by artillery, they hide in a graveyard,
where the force of the shelling causes the buried corpses to emerge
from their graves, as groups of living men fall dead around them.
After this gruesome event, the surviving soldiers return to their
camp, where they kill lice and think about what they will do at
the end of the war. Some of the men have tentative plans, but all
of them seem to feel that the war will never end. Paul fears that
if the war did end, he wouldn’t know what to do with himself. Himmelstoss
arrives at the front; when the men see him, Tjaden insults
him. The men’s lieutenant gives them light punishment but also lectures
Himmelstoss about the futility of saluting at the front. Paul and
Kat find a house with a goose and roast the goose for supper, enjoying
a rare good meal.
The company is caught in a bloody battle with a charging
group of Allied infantrymen. Men are blown apart, limbs are severed
from torsos, and giant rats pick at the dead and the wounded. Paul
feels that he must become an animal in battle, trusting only his
instincts to keep him alive. After the battle, only thirty-two of
eighty men are still alive. The men are given a short reprieve at
a field depot. Paul and some of his friends go for a swim, which
ends in a rendezvous with a group of French girls. Paul desperately
wishes to recapture his innocence with a girl, but he feels that
it is impossible to do so.
Paul receives seventeen days of leave and goes home to
see his family. He feels awkward and oppressed in his hometown,
unable to discuss his traumatic experiences with anyone. He learns
that his mother is dying of cancer and that Kantorek has been conscripted
as a soldier, from which he derives a certain cold satisfaction.
He visits Kemmerich’s mother and tells her, untruthfully, that her
son’s death was instant and painless. At the end of his leave, Paul
spends some time at a training camp near a group of Russian prisoners-of-war. Paul
feels that the Russians are people just like him, not subhuman enemies,
and wonders how war can make enemies of people who have no grudge
against one another.
Paul is sent back to his company and is reunited with
his friends. The kaiser, the German emperor, pays a visit to the
front, and the men are disappointed to see that he is merely a short
man with a weak voice. In battle, Paul is separated from his company
and forced to hide in a shell hole. A French soldier jumps into
the shell hole with him, and Paul instinctively stabs him. As the
man dies a slow, painful death, Paul is overcome with remorse for
having hurt him. He feels again that this enemy soldier
is no enemy at all but rather a victim of war just like himself.
Paul looks through the soldier’s things and finds that his name
was Gérard Duval and learns that Duval had a wife and child at home.
When he returns to his company, Paul recounts the incident to his
friends, who try to console him.
Paul and his friends are given an easy assignment:
for three weeks, they are to guard a supply depot away from the
fighting. When the next battle takes place, Paul and Kropp are wounded
and forced to bribe a sergeant-major with cigars in order to be
placed on the hospital train together. At the hospital, Paul undergoes
surgery. Kropp’s leg is amputated, and he becomes extremely depressed.
After his surgery, Paul has a short leave at home before he returns
to his company.
